# ICRM History

It is generally accepted that the ICRM as a formal organization grew
from the good and efficient contacts among radionuclide metrologists
from several countries who participated in the First International
Summer School on Radionuclide Metrology in Hercig Novi, Yugoslavia from
21 August to 1 September, 1972. The excellent proceedings of that first
meeting were published as a Special Issue of *Nuclear Instruments and
Methods* (NIM **112**(1-2) 1973). The [Bylaws](bylaws/icrm-bylaws.pdf)
were adopted at the General Meeting in Gaithersburg, Maryland (USA) in
May 1997.

This was not the first meeting of radionuclide metrologists. Because of
the increasing number of fission product and accelerator produced
radionuclides after mid-century, there were a growing number of national
standards laboratories developing methods of absolute standardization.
Recognizing the needs the International Atomic Energy Agency had
organized two international symposia. The proceeding of the first of
these, held in Vienna from 14-16 October, 1959 was published by the IAEA
as "Metrology of Radionuclides," IAEA STI/PUB 6, Vienna, 1960. The
proceedings of the second symposium, about six years later, were
published as "Standardization of Radionuclides," IAEA STI/PUB 139,
Vienna, 1967.

Many of the same participants attended these three meetings, and by the
time of the Hercig Novi Summer School there was a growing consensus that
the community was large enough to support a permanent committee to
promote applications of radionuclide metrology. A listing of the
Editorial Board for the Proceedings of the Hercig Novi Summer School is
given below. This list serves to demonstrate the widespread interest in
the growing field and to give the names of prominent metrologists who
were to play leading roles in the organization over the next three
decades.

Two of these individuals, in particular, had prepared draft histories of
the ICRM covering different periods of time. Dr. Dj. Bek-Uzarov from the
Boris Kidric Institute in Belgrade, Yugoslavia (Serbia) gave an account
of the formative years of the ICRM up until 1981. Dr. Walter Bambynek,
from the European Community laboratory in Geel, Belgium (the Central
Bureau for Nuclear Measurements or “Euratom” was renamed the Institute
for Reference Materials and Measurements in 1992 and, in 2016, the
JRC-Geel) updated this account to 1990. Efforts continue toward
combining these valuable records, and bring the history up to date in
the 21st century.

This complete history will certainly include a comprehensive
bibliography of the proceedings of the General Meetings of the ICRM and
the proceedings from topical workshops and symposia sponsored by the
Working Groups. The most recent examples are the proceedings of the
ICRM1999 Prague conference in *Applied Radiation and Isotopes* **52**(3)
2000. And the Proceedings of the ICRM Low-Level Radioactivity
Measurement Techniques Conference, held in Mol, Belgium in 1999
(*Applied Radiation and Isotopes* **53**(1-2) 2000). Comparing the
contributions in these volumes with those from the Hercig Novi Summer
School gives an indication of the tremendous progress in radionuclide
metrology and its applications during the latter part of the
20<sup>th</sup> century.
