# Technical Series

After many years of publishing the full proceedings in Special Issues of the
journal *Applied Radiation and Isotopes*, active participation in the ICRM
conferences had increased to the point that, in 2016 (before the 2017
Conference), the ICRM Scientific Committee made the decision to expand the
opportunity to publish additional manuscripts in this “ICRM Technical Series.”
In this way, the goal of the ICRM to provide an international forum for the
sharing of information and technical advance in radionuclide metrology is
realized for an even larger audience.
