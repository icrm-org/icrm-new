## Working Groups

ICRM activities are largely the responsibility of its working groups. Each group
is guided by a coordinator who acts as a centre for ideas and communications and
may organize conferences and workshops. There are now seven working groups with
the following fields of interest and assigned coordinators:

<span id="LLMT"></span> **Low Level Measurement Techniques Working
Group**

<img src="images/Arctic.jpg" data-align="right" data-border="1"
data-hspace="4" width="300" height="205" alt="Iceberg in the Arctic" />The
ICRM working group for Low-Level Measurements Techniques (LLMT) examines
techniques to enable the detection of ever smaller amounts of
radioactivity. This enables, for example, collecting smaller samples and
realising new applications involving radionuclides. The working group
focuses on metrology and the latest developments in a variety of areas,
including measurement of environmental radioactivity, radionuclides in
food and drinking water, reference materials characterisation, tracer
studies and nuclear physics research. Conference proceedings are
published in refereed scientific journals.

The Low-Level Radioactivity Measurement Techniques (ICRM-LLRMT) 2020
Conference is a five-day topical meeting of the [International Committee
for Radionuclide Metrology (ICRM)](./index.html). The INFN-LNGS is
pleased to host the conference at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in
Italy, 2-6 May 2022 . <https://icrm2022.lngs.infn.it>. The conference
brings together 130-150 worldwide experts for presentations and
discussion covering the techniques, applications and data in the field
of low-level radioactivity measurement. The conference in 2022 will be
the first time it is hosted in the Italy.

It is foreseen **that proceedings will be published in a refereed
international journal** (such as, for example, *Applied Radiation &
Isotopes*). **Abstracts will be asked to be submitted late in 2021** at
the conference website.

<span id="NNND"></span> [Nuclear Decay Data Working
Group](http://www.lnhb.fr/home/conferences-publications/icrm_ndd_wg/)

The Nuclear Decay Data Working Group (3NDWG) facilitates awareness and
communications between ICRM members interested in the measurement,
calculation, compilation and evaluation of decay data, and the
maintenance of computer-based decay data files (e.g., half-lives;
energies and emission probabilities of alpha particles, beta particles,
gamma rays, x-rays, conversion electrons and Auger electrons; internal
conversion coefficients; transition types; and other relevant
parameters, including uncertainties).

Members of the 3NDWG are encouraged to use the Working Group to
communicate experimental and theoretical work, relevant evaluation
procedures, their decay data problems, and to establish methodologies
that are fully consistent with the satisfactory production of
recommended decay data.

The 3NDWG Coordinator strives to maintain satisfactory links between all
active members to achieve the primary aim (see above), and to inform
them of all relevant activities identified with the creation and
maintenance of decay-data files.

<span id="LS"></span> **Life Sciences Working Group**

<img src="images/vials_syringes.jpg" data-hspace="4" data-align="right"
width="400" height="256"
alt="ampoule and syringes with radiopharmaceutical" /> The purpose of
the Life Sciences Working Group is to provide a forum for ICRM members
to address radionuclide metrology issues as they relate to the life
sciences. Issues may include, but are not limited to: development of
methodologies to calibrate short-lived radionuclides of interest in
nuclear medicine, measurement of decay properties (half-lives, decay
energies and probabilities, etc.) of radionuclides used in nuclear
medicine and biological research, development of measurement
methodologies for transferring National Measurement Standards to the
clinic and research laboratory, and development of methods to perform
radioactivity assays of brachytherapy sources. The Working Group will
facilitate finding solutions to these problems through workshops,
publications, electronic communications (i.e., email), and collaborative
work. The Coordinator will maintain communication links between the
members and will periodically report to the group new issues and
advancements in the field.

data-align="right" width="400" height="320" alt="Th-229 graph" />**Radionuclide
Metrology Techniques Working Group**

The ICRM Radionuclide Metrology Working Group (RMT-WG) consists of
experts in the field of radionuclide metrology. Meetings of the RMT-WG
are held approximately annually as a forum for practitioners to share
ongoing developments, gain input from peers on challenges, and work
together to address common needs. Historically, a focus has been on
4πβ-γ coincidence counting, and its variants. More recently, that topic
has broadened to address the metrology of counting for a variety of
measurement methods, and especially the many aspects of absolute
counting using digital electronics, which has become an RMT-WG subgroup.
Radioactive gas counting and large area source measurements are also
fields of significant interest to become subgroups of RMT-WG. The RMT-WG
covers other topics important to the radionuclide metrology community,
from quantitative source preparation to informing the community about
proper citations in manuscripts. To this end, the RMT-WG liaises with
other ICRM WGs, the CCRI(II) and its WGs, the BIPM, and other
stakeholders.
