## Gamma-Ray Spectrometry Working Group

Gamma-ray spectrometry is a widely used analysis technique, with applications in
a large range of fields and expertise. The ICRM Gamma Spectrometry Working Group
(GSWG) is devoted to the development of the metrological aspects of gamma-ray
spectrometry and its applications.

This includes, but is not restricted to:

- Characterization of measurement techniques and instrumentation,
- Determination of photon emission intensities,
- Determination and assessment of corrective factors and uncertainties,
- Determination of activity of gamma-emitting radionuclides for industrial, or
  safety applications, etc.

The GSWG promotes collaboration between the WG members to improve the analytical
techniques and distributes practical information in order to disseminate the
knowledge and know-how to various laboratories.
