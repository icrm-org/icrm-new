# LSWG Meeting April 8–9, 2024

## Announcement

[PDF version](./lswg-announcement-2024.pdf){: .btn .btn-green}

The Life Sciences Working Group (LS-WG) of the ICRM is planning a meeting to
take place on the **8–9 April 2024** hosted by the **National Centre for Nuclear
Research, Radioisotope Centre POLATOM in Warsaw, Poland.** As you may be aware,
the LSC-WG is planning a meeting on 11–12 April at the same venue (details sent
separately by the LSC-WG Coordinator). These meetings have been scheduled
together to take advantage of the large overlap in these groups and potentially
make it easier to plan and justify travel. There will be an opportunity to visit
the POLATOM laboratories on 10 April between the two working group meetings.
Please be aware plans are still being finalized.

The purpose of the Working Group meeting will be to discuss issues that
typically cannot be addressed at the general ICRM meeting due to time
limitations. Additionally, open discussions are encouraged on topics suggested
by the participants. Learning opportunities are available for those new to the
field. The goal is to also provide an opportunity for members of the LS-WG to
present results of works in progress (or recently completed), as well as to plan
future LS-WG activities.

The specific agenda will be drawn up in March, subject to the interests of the
participants. Potential topics are:

- New standardizations of radionuclides used in nuclear medicine
- New nuclear data for radionuclides used in nuclear medicine
- Transfer of standards to users
- Standards for nuclear medicine imaging
- Monte Carlo simulation of radionuclide calibrator response to beta-emitters
- Collection and sharing of radionuclide calibrator response curves
- Current measurements in secondary standard ionization chambers
- Time dependent radionuclide calibrator settings
- Comparisons: proposals, updates, guidance

This list is intended only as a suggestion. Please note that it is not the
intent of the working group to limit the definition of Life Science to medical
uses.

I would encourage everyone planning to attend to give a presentation in order to
promote discussion and possible cooperation between laboratories with similar
interests. Since this is intended to be an informal working meeting, there will
be no proceedings, although the presentations may be distributed to other
participants, subject to the agreement of the presenter.

If you are planning to attend the meeting, I would ask that you indicate your
interest as soon as possible and **no later than 7 February 2024.** Please
indicate
the titles and estimated times of any presentations.

To assist in your planning the meeting location is in downtown Warsaw at the
[conference room “Workin”](
https://workin-senatorska.pl/en/oferta/conference-rooms/) located at Senatorska 2.
