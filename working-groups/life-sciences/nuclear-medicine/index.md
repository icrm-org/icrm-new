# Nuclear Medicine

National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) develop the standards of activity
measurement for those radionuclides used in Nuclear Medicine. Much research is
ongoing, both to develop primary methods of activity measurement and to
facilitate secondary methods. Primary standards of measurement can be
disseminated in a number of ways. First, through the use of standard reference
materials (SRMs), or artifact standards that are directly relatable to the
primary standards of measurement. In many cases the short half life of many
radionuclides in nuclear medicine prevents the dissemination of this type of
standard. NMIs also offer calibration services, where measurement of a source at
the NMI is possible after measurement by the user or simultaneous measurement of
related sources is performed. Finally, standards may be disseminated through the
calibration of an instrument.

The most common instrument used source manufacturers, hospitals, and clinics,
for the measurement of activity is the ionization chamber based radionuclide
calibrator, in some cases referred to as a dose calibrator. Use of these
instruments requires an understanding of their operation and what aspects of a
measurement can have a measurable effect on the outcome of that measurement.
