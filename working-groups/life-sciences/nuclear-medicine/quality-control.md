# Quality Control in measurements of activity

Once traceability of a measurement has been established, proper quality control
of the instrument is essential in maintaining that traceability. Standards and
regulations for the necessary measurements vary from country to country, with
international guidance for developing countries being given by the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

Generally these documents give recommendations for the acceptance testing and
ongoing testing, usually with acceptable tolerances, required to maintain a
radionuclide calibrator. These tests include, but are not limited to: linearity,
accuracy, constancy, background, and effects of measurement geometry.
