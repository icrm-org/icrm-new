# Measurement Comparisons

Traceability of activity measurements in Nuclear Medicine requires establishing
an unbroken chain of measurements, with stated uncertainties, back to a primary
standard. An important tool in the maintenance and testing of this measurement
chain is the measurement comparison. A well planned and executed comparison can
shed light on existing measurements challenges, document improvement of
measurements, and/or bring assurance and confidence that measurements are being
made correctly.

The following documents describe the procedures used for comparisons, motivation
for comparisons, methods for interpreting results, or describe results of
previous comparisons and comparison program.
