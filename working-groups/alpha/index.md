## Alpha-Particle Spectrometry Working Group

Within the last years, the development of new techniques for the fabrication of
Si detectors and the design of new measurement chambers, has produced
considerable advances in the field of alpha-particle spectrometry with
semiconductor detectors. Peak resolutions are now close to 8.5 keV, approaching
the theoretical limit attainable with this kind of detectors. From the side of
numerical analysis of spectra, a major effort has been dedicated by several
laboratories to produce reliable fitting programs. Although it is difficult to
give a comprehensive listing of activities, the following items describe the
main areas of research.

- Development of new measurement techniques
- Improvement of fitting programs
- Measurement of nuclear data with emphasis on alpha-particle emission
  probabilities
- Computer simulation of the physical processes in the detector and source
