# Beta Particle Spectrometry Working Group

<http://www.lnhb.fr/home/conferences-publications/icrm_bs_wg/>

This Working Group is devoted to the development of the metrological aspects of
beta-particle spectrometry and its applications. This includes, but is not
restricted to:

- Theory
  - Beta ($\beta\pm$) and electron capture ($\varepsilon$) transitions
  - Theoretical shape factors and influence of the nuclear current
  - Atomic effects

- Experiments
  - Instrumentations used for beta spectrometry
  - Techniques that need beta information
  - Confidence on experimental shape factors
  - Data analysis and unfolding methods

- Simulations
  - Confidence on the physical processes: low energies, radioactive decays,
    atomic rearrangements
  - Comparison of the results of different software: Geant4, Penelope, etc.

- Evaluations and dissemination
  - Confidence and uncertainties on experimental shape factors
  - Evaluation procedure for establishing recommended experimental shape factors
  - Mean energies, $\log f t$ values, database

Other topic suggestions are welcome.
