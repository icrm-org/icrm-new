This Working Group is devoted to the development of the metrological aspects of
beta-particle spectrometry and its applications. This includes, but is not
restricted to:

## Theory

- Beta (β±) and electron capture (ε) transitions
- Theoretical shape factors and influence of the nuclear current
- Atomic effects

## Experiments

- Instrumentations used for beta spectrometry
- Techniques that need beta information
- Confidence on experimental shape factors
- Data analysis and unfolding methods

## Simulations

- Confidence on the physical processes: low energies, radioactive decays, atomic
  rearrangements
- Comparison of the results of different software: Geant4, Penelope, etc.

## Evaluations and dissemination

- Confidence and uncertainties on experimental shape factors
- Evaluation procedure for establishing recommended experimental shape factors
- Mean energies, log *ft* values, database
